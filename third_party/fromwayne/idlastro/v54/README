Procedures in the default version of the IDL Astro Library are meant to work
for versions V5.1 or later.   This directory contains updates of procedures
that take advantage of new features instroduced in IDL V5.4.    These
procedures will *not* work in earlier versions of IDL.     Currently, these
procedures must be considered "beta" versions, since they have not been
extremely well tested.

Current procedures in this directory.

            STRING() formatting has been removed.

FTPUT -    Remove call to FSTRING()
