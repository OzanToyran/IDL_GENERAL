Procedures in the default version of the IDL Astro Library are meant to work
for versions V5.2 or later.   This directory contains updates of procedures
that take advantage of new features in IDL V5.3.    These procedures will *not*
work in earlier versions of IDL.     Currently, these procedures must be
considered "beta" versions, since they have not been extremely well tested.

21-Jan-2003: Moved DBHELP, DBINDEX, DBINDEX_BLK, DBFIND_SORT, DBEXT_IND, 
             FITS_OPEN to main library which now assumes at least V5.2



19-Sep-2001: Moved CLEANPLOT, FREBIN, GCIRC, QUADTERP, TABINV, YDN2MD to main
library 

BREAK_PATH() 1. Use STRSPLIT() instead of STR_SEP()
