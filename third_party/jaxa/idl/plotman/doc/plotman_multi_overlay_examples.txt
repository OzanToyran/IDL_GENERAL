EXAMPLES OF SEARCH PATTERNS IN PLOTMAN MULTI OVERLAY INTERFACE  03-Feb-2010

 Assume we have a PLOTMAN session with the following panels: 
 Clean 13:01 3-6keV
 Clean 13:01 6-12keV
 Clean 13:01 12-25keV
 Clean 13:22 3-6keV
 Clean 13:22 6-12keV
 Clean 13:22 12-25keV
 Pixon 13:01 6-12keV
 Pixon 13:01 12-25keV
 Sim 1
 Sim 2
 Sim 3
 Recon 1 clean
 Recon 1 pixon
 Recon 2 clean
 Recon 2 pixon
 Recon 3 clean
 Recon 3 pixon
 
 
 SIMPLE SEARCHES. ASSUME YOU'VE SELECTED THESE BASE PANELS:
 Pixon 13:01 6-12keV
 Pixon 13:01 12-25keV
 
	Base pattern = blank, Overlay pattern = clean
	Finds the first two panels with clean in the name.  Result:
	 Clean 13:01 3-6keV
	 Clean 13:01 6-12keV
	 
	Base pattern = blank, Overlay pattern = clean*12-25*
	Finds the first two panels with 'clean' anything '12-25'.  Result:
	 Clean 13:01 12-25keV
	 Clean 13:22 12-25keV
	 
	Base pattern = pixon, overlay pattern = clean
	For each base panel name, replace 'pixon' by 'clean' and search. Result: 
	 Clean 13:01 6-12keV
	 Clean 13:01 12-25keV
 

SEARCHES USING !.  ASSUME YOU'VE SELECTED THESE BASE PANELS:
 Recon 2 pixon
 Recon 3 pixon
 
	Base pattern = recon!!, Overlay pattern = sim!!
	Force the two characters after recon in base panel to match 2 characters after sim in overlays.
	 e.g. for first base panel, search string is 'sim 2*'. Note: if you didn't use the !! to force
	 the match and just searched for sim, it would have found 'Sim 1' and 'Sim 2'.  Result:
	 Sim 2
	 Sim 3
	 
	 Base pattern = recon!!, Overlay pattern = recon!!*clean
	 Force the two characters after recon in base panel to match 2 characters after recon in 
	 overlays, followed by anthing followed by clean. e.g. for first base panel, search 
	 string is 'recon 2*clean*'
	 Recon 2 clean
	 Recon 3 clean
	 
	 NOTE: You can use more than one set of !s to require more than one part of the basea and
	   overlay strings to match, but you must have an equal number of ! groups in the base and
	   overlay patterns.
