Questions:

1) 
  1- "the equation states that the electrode configuration should be such as to yield minimum E_w. If the electrons path, for example, is made to coincide with an equipotential of the grid, the induced current will be zero" BUT, it should be collected somehow???
------------------------------------------------------------->>>>>>>>.
2)
  1- Why Ge is better then Silicon??
  2- "these spectra have been normalized with respect to the integrated counts in the photopeak of the thirs harmonic" ???
  3- Warm carrier escape?
  4- Do CdZnTe detectors have escape peaks, or escape of fluorescence photons?
  5- When the energetic photoelectron travels and 'creates' electron hole pairs, what is the mechanism?? Compton ??
  6- What is hopping conduction ??
  7- "noise considerations ????"
---------------------------------------------------------------->>>>>>>>.
3)
  1- Why CdZnTe better than other high Z materials?
  2- Why small pixel effect causes a better charge collection?
----------------------------------------------------------------->>>>>>>>.
4)
  1- "polarization effect "?????
  2- what are the parameters for deciding voltage difference between a, se??
  3- What is compton continuum backgrounf ??
  4- "spatial  non-uniformity in electron trapping ,asymmetry in the grid electrode structure " what kind of contribution?
  5- "also corrects for electron trapping effects " ????
  6- What is a pulser??
  7- *** Explain figure 10 ***???
  8- How reducing the amplitude variations can affect the resolution?
  9- What is polarization effect???
